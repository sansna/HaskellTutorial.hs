Haskell Introduction
======

This Repo is created to store exercises while I am learning haskell.

For a quick reference to all keywords used in Haskell, goto
https://wiki.haskell.org/Keywords.

Before trying any of the scripts online, notice that all haskell scripts
should be aligned with *SPACES*, no tabs allowed, otherwise it may cause
undetermined problems.

Most of them can be found transformed from other scripts. But I know
these scripts will not cause legal problems.

Some concepts learned from haskell:
1.currying
2.IO value of multi-type
3.concept of field/ring

After learning Haskell for sometime, I found this language is not suitable
for developing *commercial* programs.

1.It is a language that focuses on conceptual learning and modeling and
might suitable for that usage, but for now, I think it is not worth my
time learning and practicing.

2.Many libs in hackage are not consistent with older versions in the
interface level.

3.[Reason clarified] Copied several examples from web/youtube into my local
environment, trying to get better understanding of its ideas, but even these 
tutorials are not working as they suggested.

4.It is slow, and its functionalities can be achieved through C code.

5. Its package management tool *cabal* is somehow broken. Stack is another tool
but I have not give it a shot. Maybe try later.

But I always suggest using haskell as a tool to get familiar with the
concept of functional programming. Though might not be accepted in nowadays
architectures, it might be adopted by future architectures.

Also, I think the lack of maintainer should kill haskell at last. This language
is *dead* to some extent.
